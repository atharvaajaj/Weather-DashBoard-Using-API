# 🌦 Weather Dashboard – Power BI  

## 📌 Repository Description  
An interactive Weather Dashboard built in **Power BI** using **WeatherAPI**, featuring AQI insights, temperature trends, and dynamic visualizations.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a **Weather Dashboard in Power BI** using data from a weather API.  
The dashboard integrates live or historical weather data and transforms it into meaningful insights for end users.  
It provides a comprehensive view of environmental conditions, enabling better understanding of patterns and trends.
